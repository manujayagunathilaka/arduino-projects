# Arduino Projects Collection

Welcome to my Arduino projects repository! This is a collection of various micro-projects, experiments, and prototypes I have built. Each project is organized into its own folder with the source code and specific documentation.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project. Inside each folder, you will find:
* `project_name.ino` - The Arduino source code.
* `README.md` - Specific instructions, hardware requirements, and circuit diagrams for that project.
